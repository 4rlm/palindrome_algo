#### PalindromeAlgo is a simple algorithm to find and return list of palindromes from your text input.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'palindrome_algo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install palindrome_algo

## Usage

1) Add your text to a hash with `:text` symbol key, then pass the arguments to `PalindromeAlgo.parse(args)` like the example below.  If you don't pass any args, and just run `PalindromeAlgo.parse` it will return sample data for testing.

```
args = { text: "My best friend's name is Anna. Don't you love the civic opera? How much is a kayak? My Spanish level is low, but I have fun. Excuse me, Madam?  Is this yours? Where's your mom today? Let's go for lunch at noon. Did you see that racecar? When was the radar invented? Your face is redder than a tomato. So we somehow refer cases to you? How much is it to repaper the living room? The rotator was connected to the log by a rope 6 ft. I heard the tail rotor buzz again. For later versions and adaptations of the sagas see O. His guitar solos are just unbelievable. As a doctor, Kent strongly believes the tenet of never doing any harm. Wow, you made this by yourself?" }

palindrome_hash = PalindromeAlgo.parse(args)
```

2) The returned data will be in hash format like below:

You can access the data, like so: `palindrome_hash[:results]` and `palindrome_hash[:text]`

```
{
  :results=>
  [
    {:string=>"My best friend's name is Anna", :palindromes=>"anna"},
    {:string=>"Don't you love the civic opera", :palindromes=>"civic"},
    {:string=>"How much is a kayak", :palindromes=>"kayak"},
    {:string=>"My Spanish level is low, but I have fun", :palindromes=>"level"},
    {:string=>"Excuse me, Madam", :palindromes=>"madam"},
    {:string=>"Is this yours", :palindromes=>""},
    {:string=>"Where's your mom today", :palindromes=>"mom"},
    {:string=>"Let's go for lunch at noon", :palindromes=>"noon"},
    {:string=>"Did you see that racecar", :palindromes=>"did, racecar"},
    {:string=>"When was the radar invented", :palindromes=>"radar"},
    {:string=>"Your face is redder than a tomato", :palindromes=>"redder"},
    {:string=>"So we somehow refer cases to you", :palindromes=>"refer"},
    {:string=>"How much is it to repaper the living room", :palindromes=>"repaper"},
    {:string=>"The rotator was connected to the log by a rope 6 ft", :palindromes=>"rotator"},
    {:string=>"I heard the tail rotor buzz again", :palindromes=>"rotor"},
    {:string=>"For later versions and adaptations of the sagas see O", :palindromes=>"sagas"},
    {:string=>"His guitar solos are just unbelievable", :palindromes=>"solos"},
    {:string=>"As a doctor, Kent strongly believes the tenet of never doing any harm", :palindromes=>"tenet"},
    {:string=>"Wow, you made this by yourself", :palindromes=>"wow"}
   ],
 :text=>
